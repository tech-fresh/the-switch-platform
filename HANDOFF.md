# Session Handoff — The Switch Platform

> **Purpose:** This file is the live handover note between **Cursor Agent** and **Codex**.
> Read it at the start of every session. Update it at the end of every session.
> Do not delete session history — add new entries at the top of the Session Log.

## Operator rule — every session

**Session start:** tell Cursor or Codex:

```text
Read HANDOFF.md first.
```

**Session end:** update the **Live session state** section below before stopping or switching tools.

## Before each action — consult first

Before **every** action — code, docs, commands, git, planning, or review — consult in order:

1. This file (`HANDOFF.md`) → Live session state, What is next, Blockers
2. **`docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md`** → current MVP completion record and deferred-scope reference
3. `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md` → Rules, architecture, modules, launch checklist
4. `README.md` → Relevant sections only (build record, launch notes)

Do not start until the action still matches live state and build priorities.

If the action touches a module, also read `src/modules/<module>/README.md`.

## After each action — update HANDOFF and AGENTS (non-negotiable)

After **every** completed action — not only at session end:

1. Refresh **`HANDOFF.md`** → **Live session state** (What was just completed, What is next, Blockers, Verification last run)
2. Refresh **`AGENTS.md`** → **Operator and agent sync**, **MVP at a glance**, and completion records so they match HANDOFF. **Required every time live state or project story changes** — no exceptions.
3. Add or refresh a **Session log** entry in this file when the action materially changed repo state, blockers, or next steps
4. Append **`README.md`** Ordered Build Record when routes, modules, or behavior changed

Commit and push when the action produced repo changes, unless a task explicitly requires a local-only commit.

## Efficiency quick reference (read this every session)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Before each task | Read `HANDOFF.md` → **`docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md`** → `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md` → README **sections only** (when needed) |
| During task | One module, one priority, match architecture gate |
| After each task | Update **HANDOFF** Live session state + **AGENTS** operator sync (non-negotiable) |
| End of session | Verification, commit, push, session log, README build record if behavior changed |

**Live site:** https://theswitchplatform.com (Fly.io production). Re-check docs vs live: `npm run verify:live-truth-match`.

## Golden rule

**Never switch between Cursor and Codex without updating `HANDOFF.md` and `AGENTS.md` first.**

Commit and push to GitHub before switching tools unless a task explicitly requires a local-only commit.

## Live session state

Update this section every session.

### Current state

- **Active folder:** `/Users/lloydnwagbara/Documents/THE SWITCH 3`
- **GitHub repo:** `https://github.com/tech-fresh/the-switch-platform`
- **Current branch:** `main` (PR #4 + PR #5 merged 23 June 2026)
- **Last updated by:** Cursor
- **Last updated:** 2026-06-26 (Priority A complete — A-6 and A-8 closed)

### Active task

- **Priority item #:** E — Deferred scope review
- **Module:** operator-gated expansion only
- **Status:** **No active blocker** — A through D complete for the current MVP
- **Branch:** `main`

### Priority C — COMPLETE (24 June 2026)

**Authoritative status:** Priorities **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D** are **closed** for the current MVP. Priority **E** is deferred scope unless the operator explicitly reopens another lane.

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| **C-1** Shell rollout | **Complete** | `StudentAppShell` on results, saved-progress, recommendations, accessibility, account (signed in) |
| **C-2** Exams focus mode | **Complete** | Lobby in shell; active paper `focus=1` — `src/lib/exams/focus-mode.ts` |
| **C-3** Support route model | **Complete** | Public marketing hub — `PublicMarketingPage` on `/support` |
| **C-4** Marketing chrome | **Complete** | `/`, `/how-it-works`, `/login`, `/support` |
| **C-5** Planner dismiss | **Complete** | `/api/dashboard/ui-preferences` |
| **C-6** Weekly planner | **Complete** | `src/modules/weekly-planner/` + `/api/planner/week` |
| **C-7** Subject tones | **Complete** | `src/lib/subjects/tone.ts` |
| **C-8** Account/auth UX | **Complete** | Account in shell when signed in; login on marketing chrome |
| **C-9** Accessibility route | **Complete** | Shell aligned (C-1) |
| **C-10** Recovery pass | **Complete** | `StudentRouteRecovery` shared component |

**Architecture gate (must hold):** route → thin page → module service → API → persistence. Weekly planner, UI preferences, and exam focus mode all follow this — no page-only business logic.

**Synced in:** `AGENTS.md` → Priority C completion record · `README.md` → Ordered Build Record · `docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md` → execution checklist.

### What was just completed

- **Final source-of-truth doc sync (26 June 2026)** — aligned `AGENTS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md`, `docs/ideas/README.md`, `docs/ideas/STREAMLINE-WEBSITE-PLAN.md`, and the Mock Idea reference docs so the active repo entry points all describe the same closed A–D / deferred E story.
- **Priority D-5 content/editorial quality pass (26 June 2026)** — updated admin, operations, CMS release-check, and subject-route copy so current live surfaces describe the MVP plainly without stale placeholder or pre-launch wording; restored the canonical 25 June Priority A evidence bundle and removed the stray failed 26 June rerun file.
- **Priority D hardening pass (26 June 2026)** — added auth session lifecycle coverage for sign-out/session denial assumptions, added `StudentAppShell` route coverage tests, and aligned launch governance assertions with the completed Priority A closeout/admin wording.
- **Priority B roadmap-reference sync (26 June 2026)** — docs that point to `FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md` now describe it as the full remaining-work audit instead of the old `FP-*` redesign tracker; historical FP references are kept but labeled as archive context.
- **Priority B stale-note cleanup (26 June 2026)** — active README/admin/governance truth surfaces now say Priority A is complete; older near-launch wording is explicitly marked as historical archive context instead of current live status.
- **Priority A doc sync (26 June 2026)** — aligned `HANDOFF`, `AGENTS`, `README`, `PLATFORM-GUIDE`, `FINAL-PHASE-PLAN`, and `.cursor/rules` so Priority A is **COMPLETE** everywhere; active lane is **Priority B**.
- **Priority A — COMPLETE (26 June 2026)** — `npm run verify:priority-a-closeout` passed end to end. **A-6** canonical evidence bundle and **A-8** truth-match green. Evidence: `release-evidence/2026-06-25-priority-a-canonical-closeout.md`. Fixed `verify-live-onboarding.mjs` dashboard shell assertion (Study Atelier / study home markers).
- **A-6 / A-8 closeout tooling** — `npm run verify:check-live-cookies`, `npm run verify:priority-a-closeout`, Fly-delegated persistence/sign-off in `launch-complete.mjs`.
- **Mock Log in visibility** — marketing header layout fixed so **Log in** is never clipped in the mock gallery; nav always visible on mobile; explicit **Log in** on homepage hero, `/mock-idea-preview` top bar, and signed-out student shell.
- **Auth allowlist showcase** — `allowlist-service.ts`, `AuthAccessPathPanel` on `/login?intent=admin`, `/account`, and `/admin`; shows student vs admin path, masked allowlist entries (admin/editor viewers), and live sign-in record (email, provider, roles, session expiry). Tests: `tests/auth-allowlist.test.mjs`. Admin sign-in URL: `/login?intent=admin&returnTo=/admin`.
- Fresh production student/admin cookies authenticated real Google OIDC sessions on `https://theswitchplatform.com`
- Strict real-auth OIDC proof passed
- Live readiness passed
- Fly production persistence recovery passed again on real `/data`
- Fly production launch sign-off passed
- Strict `npm run verify:live-truth-match` passed after blanking `SWITCH_LAUNCH_VERIFICATION_SECRET` for the process
- `launch-complete`, `live-truth-match`, `verify-live-oidc-proof`, and related helpers were hardened for real-provider selection, Fly runtime `npm`, delegated sign-off, and stricter real-auth sequencing

### What is next

- **Priority E** — deferred scope review only if the operator wants Wales/NI, parent/teacher variants, or other expansion beyond the current MVP
- Re-run `npm run verify:priority-a-closeout` after cookie refresh when repeating closeout for a new release

### Completion snapshot

- **Priority A:** `8 / 8` complete
- **Priority B:** `4 / 4` complete
- **Priority C:** `10 / 10` complete
- **Priority D:** `6 / 6` complete
- **Overall active plan:** `28 / 28` complete (`100%`)

### Blockers

- **None** for Priority A (A-1 through A-8 complete 26 June 2026)
- Live cookies expire periodically — refresh via `/account/live-cookie-guide` before re-running closeout

### Verification last run

- [x] `npm run verify:check-live-cookies`
- [x] `npm run verify:launch-status`
- [x] `npm run verify:live-onboarding`
- [x] `npm run verify:launch-complete`
- [x] `npm run verify:live-truth-match` (A-8)
- [x] `npm run verify:priority-a-closeout` (A-6 canonical bundle)
- [x] `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test` (111 tests)

## Plain-English — what the project is doing (operator + agents)

**Read this section with `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` → Operator and agent sync.** All three stay aligned; live task detail is always in **Live session state** above.

### In one sentence

The Switch is a **live GCSE revision platform** (https://theswitchplatform.com). **Priority C** (product finish), **Priority A** (truthful completion), and **Priority D** (quality/tests and copy hardening) are **complete**. Only deferred Priority E scope remains.

### Where we are

| Stage | Plain English | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Final Path Mark 2** | All 22 launch items proved on Fly production | **Complete — 26 June 2026** |
| **Priority A — truthful completion** | A-1 through A-8 with canonical evidence bundle | **Complete — 26 June 2026** |
| **Priority C — product finish** | Shell, exams focus mode, planner, marketing chrome, recovery UI | **Complete — 24 June 2026** |
| **Prior polish (Phases 1–2)** | Marketing shell, dashboard declutter, shell on main study routes | **Done** |
| **Final Phase — current MVP** | **Priorities A–D complete** | **Closed** |
| **Optional (FP-6)** | Wales/NI GCSE, parent/teacher onboarding, admin restyle | **Operator gate only** |

### Two lanes — do not mix them

| Lane | What it means | Do |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **A — Onboarding** | 8-step guided setup **creates the student dashboard** (subjects, support, access) | **Keep all 8 steps.** Secondary school + England GCSE/iGCSE only for MVP. Wales/NI signposted “coming later”. |
| **B — Website shell** | Public homepage + signed-in dashboard layout | **Complete** — Priority C shipped 24 June 2026 |

### Onboarding MVP (locked 24 June 2026)

| Step | Learner sees | MVP rule |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 1 Qualification | GCSE (England) or iGCSE | Wales + Northern Ireland = **coming later** (visible, not selectable) |
| 3 School | Secondary school name | **England only** nation picker + official England school link |
| 8 Consent | Open my dashboard | Incomplete users cannot reach `/dashboard` until finished |

Full detail: `src/modules/onboarding/README.md` · **Active plan:** `docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md`

### Doc read order (every session)

```mermaid

  P --> R["4. README sections\nwhen handoff points"]
  H --> M["Module README\nif touching one module"]
```

| Doc | You read it for |
|-----|-----------------|
| `HANDOFF.md` | **What is happening now**, next steps, blockers |
| **`docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md`** | **Completion record** — current MVP closeout + deferred scope |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent entry + launch list (same story as here) |
| `README.md` | Product rules + **Ordered Build Record** (history) |
| `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md` | Architecture, modules, 22-item list detail |
| `docs/ideas/` | Plan index — **FINAL-PHASE-PLAN** active; prior plans historical |
| `docs/MOCK-IDEA-*.md` | UI build direction |

---

## Dual-agent document system (Cursor + Codex)

**Plain English:** Two AI tools share one repo. **`HANDOFF.md` is the baton** — whoever finishes must update it before the other starts. The four core markdown files below stay in sync; do not let them drift.

### Who does what

| Tool | Best for | Must read first | Must update before handoff |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Cursor Agent** | Multi-file UI, API, tests, terminal, git | `HANDOFF.md` | `HANDOFF.md` Live session state + **`AGENTS.md` sync** + session log |
| **Codex** | Planning, review, debugging, focused service logic | `HANDOFF.md` | Same |

### The four core markdown files — read and write

| File | Read when | Write when | Plain English |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **`HANDOFF.md`** | **Every session start** | **After every action** + session end | *What is happening right now* — live task, blockers, next step |
| **`AGENTS.md`** | Session start (after HANDOFF) | **After every action** when live state or project story changes — **non-negotiable** | *Front door for agents* — same story as HANDOFF, links inward |
| **`PLATFORM-GUIDE.md`** | Before code or module work | When architecture, modules, or dev rules change | *How to build* — rules, modules, 22-item list detail |
| **`README.md`** | When handoff points (build record, MVP spec) | **Append only** — Ordered Build Record + MVP notes | *Product history* — what we asked for and what shipped (never delete old records) |

**Rule:** If you change the project story (MVP scope, lanes, live status), update **HANDOFF + AGENTS + README operator section + PLATFORM-GUIDE session/MVP notes** in the same session.

```mermaid

### Standard prompt — paste into Cursor or Codex

```text
Project: The Switch Platform Mark 3.2
Root: /Users/lloydnwagbara/Documents/THE SWITCH 3
Live: https://theswitchplatform.com

Read HANDOFF.md first.

Then read in order:
1. HANDOFF.md → Live session state + Plain-English story + MVP at a glance
2. docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md → current closeout record and any operator-approved Priority E item
3. AGENTS.md → agent entry
4. PLATFORM-GUIDE.md → rules + modules (section handoff points to)
5. README.md → sections only when handoff points (build record, MVP spec)

Task: [one module only — pick from FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md]
Priority #: 5 Dashboard (Final Phase)

Rules:
- Dual-agent: update HANDOFF before switching tools; commit + push when done
- Onboarding stays (8 steps) — builds dashboard; England GCSE + iGCSE MVP
- Active plan: docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md — prior phases complete
- One module per session; API-first; mobile + accessibility first

On completion:
- npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test
- Update HANDOFF Live session state + session log
- Append README Ordered Build Record if behavior changed
- Commit and push
```

## Session start checklist

Before any code or doc change:

1. Tell the agent: `Read HANDOFF.md first.`
2. Read this file (`HANDOFF.md`) → Live session state + What is next
3. Read **`docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md`** → next open Priority **B** or **D** item
4. Read `AGENTS.md` → Session rules, architecture, and completion standard
5. Read `README.md` → Non-negotiable development rules + Active build priority order
6. Read `PROJECT_RECOVERY.md` if folder or history context is unclear
7. Read the relevant `src/modules/<module>/README.md`
8. Run `git status` and `git pull origin main` (or checkout the active feature branch)
9. Confirm the task maps to **one module** and one Final Phase priority item (B, D, or E — not A or C unless reopened)
10. Paste the standard session prompt below into the active tool

---

## Session end checklist

Before stopping or switching tools:

1. Run `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test`
2. Run `npm run test:smoke` if routes or pages changed
3. Run `npm run verify:release` for bigger release or launch-path changes
4. Commit with a clear module-focused message
5. Confirm push to GitHub succeeded
6. Update **Live session state** in this file
7. Add a new **Session log** entry at the top
8. Append to `README.md` Ordered Build Record if routes, modules, or behavior changed

---

## Standard session prompt

Copy into Cursor or Codex at the start of each session:

```text
Project: The Switch Platform Mark 3.2
Root: /Users/lloydnwagbara/Documents/THE SWITCH 3
GitHub: https://github.com/tech-fresh/the-switch-platform

Session start instruction: Read HANDOFF.md first.

Read first:
1. HANDOFF.md
2. AGENTS.md
3. README.md priorities and non-negotiable rules
4. src/modules/<relevant-module>/README.md

Task: [one module only]
This task serves priority #: [number or setup/launch]

Rules:
- Follow build priority order unless explicitly overridden
- One module per session
- API-first: no business logic only in page components
- Use src/lib/server/api.ts wrappers in API routes
- Do not mix exam, progress, content, or access-arrangements logic across modules
- Mobile-first and accessibility-first
- Append README build record if routes/modules/behavior changed

On completion:
- lint, type-check, test
- commit and push
- update HANDOFF.md live session state and session log

Do NOT use THE SWITCH or THE SWITCH 2 folders.
```

---

## Branch and concurrency rules

- Default branch: `main`
- Use `feature/<module>-<short-description>` for focused feature work when requested
- One feature branch per task when branching
- Do not let Cursor and Codex edit the same branch with uncommitted changes
- Commit, push, and update this file before switching tools
- Do not delete rules, routes, modules, or documentation unless explicitly requested

---

## Tool split

| Work type | Preferred tool |
|-----------|----------------|
| Multi-file UI + API + tests | Cursor Agent |
| File edits, refactors, UI changes, code navigation | Cursor Agent |
| Focused module service logic | Codex or Cursor |
| Planning, reviewing, debugging, explaining changes | Codex |
| PRs, repo search, terminal verification | Cursor Agent |
| Design-system UI following Changes 1.0 | Either — follow `AGENTS.md` Design System Index |

---

## Active build priority order

State which priority item each task serves. Do not skip higher-priority work unless explicitly overridden — record the reason here and in the README build record if you do.

1. Exam Engine
2. Power Grid
3. Saved Progress
4. Read Aloud
5. Dashboard
6. Timed Assessments
7. Full GCSE Exams
8. Content Fact-Checking And Editorial Workflow
9. Results
10. Recommendations
11. Accessibility
12. Access Arrangements foundation

Special labels:

- `setup` — project workflow, docs, multi-agent process
- `launch — Final Path Mark 2` — live deployment, auth, persistence, governance verification

---

## Final Path Mark 2 — live state (23 June 2026)

**Authoritative completion list:** this section **and** `AGENTS.md` **and** `README.md` → Full End-to-End Completion List (22 items). Also mirrored in `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md`.

**Preservation rule:** This is the **final** launch checklist. **Do not replace, shorten, or delete** these 22 items. Do not overwrite session log history below — only append status updates and evidence.

Plain-English: this is the full launch checklist. Every line must be green before we call the platform “100% complete.” **All 22 items are now complete** on Fly production.

### Full End-to-End Completion List (22 items — final, do not replace)

1. Configure the real live auth environment (`SWITCH_AUTH_MODE=oidc`, secrets, base URL, one complete OIDC provider block).

## Architecture gate

Every change must follow this flow:

```text
UI route (src/app) → thin component → module service (src/modules) → contracts/types → API route (src/app/api) → persistence (src/lib/persistence)
```

Rules:

- Keep modules independent
- No business logic only in `src/app/**/page.tsx`
- API routes use helpers from `src/lib/server/api.ts`
- Do not mix exam logic with progress logic
- Do not mix saved progress with content logic
- Keep Read Aloud separate from revision and quiz logic
- Keep Access Arrangements independent from other modules
- All student progress must auto-save
- Mobile-first UI and accessibility-first design

## Daily routine

### Start

- [ ] Open `/Users/lloydnwagbara/Documents/THE SWITCH 3`
- [ ] `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Read this file → Active task + What is next + Blockers
- [ ] Read `AGENTS.md` + relevant module README
- [ ] Create or checkout feature branch if needed
- [ ] Paste standard session prompt
- [ ] State which priority # the task serves

### During

- [ ] One module only
- [ ] Match existing codebase patterns
- [ ] UI work: follow `AGENTS.md` Design System Index
- [ ] No cross-module logic mixing

### End

- [ ] `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test`
- [ ] `npm run test:smoke` if routes changed
- [ ] Commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] Update Live session state in this file
- [ ] Add Session log entry
- [ ] Append README build record if product behavior changed

---

## Switching between Cursor and Codex

1. Complete the **Session end checklist**
2. Update **Live session state** — especially What is next and Blockers
3. Add a **Session log** entry naming the tool you are leaving
4. Commit and push
5. Open the other tool on `/Users/lloydnwagbara/Documents/THE SWITCH 3`
6. Run `git pull`
7. Read this file and paste the **Standard session prompt**

---

## Key files to read early

- `AGENTS.md` — rules, priorities, design system, completion standard
- `README.md` — product spec and build history
- `package.json` — scripts and commands
- `src/lib/server/api.ts` — API route wrappers
- `src/lib/persistence/runtime.ts` — persistence mode and storage paths
- `src/modules/exam-engine/service.ts` — highest-priority exam logic
- `src/modules/saved-progress/service.ts` — autosave and progress logic
- `src/modules/power-grid/service.ts` — progress and action summary logic

---

## Completion standard

- Complete each task fully before moving on
- Fix errors found during the task before calling work done
- Do not consider work complete until it builds, runs, and passes the relevant checks
- Verify git push succeeded before reporting completion
- Only change what the task asks for — no silent unrelated refactors

---

## Session log (newest first)

Add a new entry here at the end of every session. Do not delete older entries.

### 2026-06-26 — Cursor — Priority A doc sync + push

- Done: synced Priority A **COMPLETE** across `HANDOFF.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md`, `docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md`, `.cursor/rules/00-source-of-truth.mdc`
- Done: MVP tables and Item 22 records now say Final Path Mark 2 + Priority A closed (26 June 2026); active lane **Priority B**
- Next: Priority B stale-notes cleanup (B-1, B-2)

### 2026-06-25 — Cursor — AGENTS.md sync rule non-negotiable

- Done: after-each-action workflow now requires **HANDOFF + AGENTS + README (when behavior changes)**
- Synced across `AGENTS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `README.md`, `PLATFORM-GUIDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/00-source-of-truth.mdc`
- Commit: `01d3664`

### 2026-06-25 — Codex — Priority A audit run + A-7 truth sync

- Done: ran strict real-auth proof commands against production
- Done: verified strict mode rejects `SWITCH_LAUNCH_VERIFICATION_SECRET`
- Done: verified current local production student cookie is stale or otherwise non-authenticating for `/api/auth/session`
- Done: proved persistence recovery on Fly production `/data` via `fly ssh console`
- Done: aligned `PLATFORM-GUIDE`, governance summary, admin launch copy, `launch-complete`, and `live-truth-match` to the same Priority A audit story
- Done: recorded current state in `release-evidence/2026-06-25-priority-a-truth-audit.md`
- Verification: `npm test`, `npm run lint`
- Next: refresh live student cookie, rerun strict proof, then continue A-3 to A-8

### 2026-06-25 — Codex — real browser OIDC proof for A-1/A-3/A-4

- Done: captured real production Google OIDC auth start and provider redirect from `/login`
- Done: re-entered a real student session on production and confirmed signed-in account state at `/account` (`Signed in via google at 24 Jun, 23:56`)
- Done: completed the full 8-step learner onboarding flow on production, unlocked the dashboard, and confirmed `/onboarding` no longer returned step 1 for the completed learner
- Done: signed out on production and confirmed `/dashboard` redirected to `/login` while `/account` rendered the signed-out state
- Done: updated plan/docs/evidence so A-1, A-3, and A-4 are recorded as complete in browser evidence
- Blocker: strict command closeout still needs a fresh `SWITCH_LIVE_STUDENT_COOKIE` and a real `SWITCH_LIVE_ADMIN_COOKIE` copied into `.env.local`
- Next: finish A-6 and A-8 after the two production cookies are refreshed via `/account/live-cookie-guide`

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — Priority C authoritative closure (docs sync)

- Done: Priority **C** marked **COMPLETE** (C-1–C-10) in HANDOFF, AGENTS, README, PLATFORM-GUIDE, FINAL-PHASE-PLAN
- Done: architecture gate documented — weekly planner, UI preferences, exam focus mode follow route → service → API → persistence
- Rule for agents: **do not reopen Priority C** unless operator requests exception; active lane is **Priority A**
- Next: A-1 production OIDC proof, then A-3–A-8 evidence sync

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — Priority C product finish shipped

- Done: C-2–C-10 — exams focus mode, support hub, marketing chrome, planner dismiss, weekly planner module, subject tones, recovery UI
- Done: commit `92cc190` pushed to `main`; verification 102/102
- Next: authoritative doc closure across HANDOFF / AGENTS / README

### 2026-06-24 — Codex — A-1/A-2 strict real-auth hardening

- Done: added `verify:live-oidc-proof` for real OIDC proof without launch-verification headers
- Done: added `verify:live-walkthrough:real-auth`; strict walkthrough now fails if `SWITCH_LAUNCH_VERIFICATION_SECRET` is present
- Done: updated `launch-status`, `repo-lint`, and regression tests for the new real-auth verification path
- Verification: `npm test` and `npm run lint` passed
- Next: run the new proof command against production with real live cookies, then continue A-3 to A-8 evidence cleanup

### 2026-06-24 — Codex — Priority A sync alignment

- Done: synced `AGENTS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and `README.md` top-level operator story to `docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md` as the active full completion audit
- Done: moved “What is next?” from C-2 product polish to **Priority A — truthful completion**
- Done: updated live-session state to reflect the proof-gap audit as the active task
- Next: implement strict real-auth verification path and retire synthetic auth from final-proof claims
- Blocker: none technical; real production proof still needs valid live auth cookies / operator run

### 2026-06-24 — Codex — Full completion audit + Final Phase rewrite

- Done: audited launch scripts, release evidence, route coverage, governance truth surfaces, and active docs
- Done: rewrote `docs/ideas/FINAL-PHASE-PLAN.md` from a UI-only roadmap into a full completion plan
- Done: split remaining work into truthful-launch blockers, docs/governance sync, product completion, quality coverage, and deferred scope
- Next: start Priority A from the new plan — remove synthetic-auth dependence from final live proof, then sync truth surfaces
- Blocker: none technical; main risk is overclaiming completion before real-auth proof is hardened

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — C-1 student shell rollout complete

- Done: `/saved-progress`, `/recommendations`, `/accessibility`, `/account` (signed-in) in `StudentAppShell`
- Done: C-1 marked complete in FINAL-PHASE-PLAN (exams/support → C-2/C-3)
- Next: C-2 `/exams` shell decision

- Next: Phase 3 planner dismiss persistence
- Blocker: none

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — Git push confirmed (docs on origin/main)

- Next: Phase 2 shell rollout
- Blocker: none

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — Full MD sync (dual-agent + MVP display)

- Done: dual-agent document system in HANDOFF; MVP at a glance in HANDOFF, AGENTS, PLATFORM-GUIDE, README

- Next: shell rollout; Wales/NI when operator prioritises
- Blocker: none

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — Onboarding stays + ideas folder plan

- Next: Phase 2 shell rollout per ideas plan
- Blocker: none

### 2026-06-24 — Cursor — Homepage + dashboard declutter (priority #5)

- Done: split `dashboard-home.tsx` into home vs dashboard layouts; removed duplicate preview/mockup sections
- Done: dashboard hides SEND side rail when `SendSupportRail` is shown; trimmed shell and planner copy
- Next: optional shell rollout to `/subjects`, `/assessments`, `/progress`; Fly browser check
- Blocker: none

### 2026-06-23 — Cursor — Item 22 marked complete in end-to-end lists

- Done: item 22 now shows **Completed — 23 June 2026** in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` Full End-to-End Completion List
- Done: replaced stale June 21 HANDOFF section that still said item 22 was open
- Done: README §58 build record added
- Plain-English: all 22 launch checklist items are done; the last one was “does the paperwork match the live site?” — yes
- PR #4 + PR #5 already on `main`; no code change in this commit

### 2026-06-23 — Cursor — PR #4 merged to main

- Merged: https://github.com/tech-fresh/the-switch-platform/pull/4
- `main` at `18920cc` — unified login, Microsoft OAuth, item 22 evidence
- Live host unchanged: https://theswitchplatform.com (Fly)

### 2026-06-23 — Cursor — Item 22 / Final Path Mark 2 complete

- Branch: cursor/unified-login-sign-in-page
- Done: full live verification bundle, truth-match passed, evidence file stored, item 22 closed
- Evidence: `release-evidence/2026-06-23-final-path-mark-2-item-22-complete.md`
- Next: merge draft PR #4
- Blocker: none

### 2026-06-23 — Cursor — Live Microsoft sign-in + item 22 truth-match (Final Path Mark 2)

- Branch: cursor/unified-login-sign-in-page (draft PR #4)
- Done: browser Microsoft sign-in for lloydnwag@gmail.com (admin+student), Azure app on Fly, sign-in UX fixes, truth-match + walkthrough + OAuth verify green
- Next: merge PR #4 to main
- Blocker: none

Plain-English summary:

- The dashboard is public — you can browse it without signing in. Sign-in happens at `/login` or `/login?reauth=1`.
- Microsoft sign-in is now proven in a real browser session, not just redirect checks.
- Admin launch view matches governance records (6/6 environment, 5/5 sign-off, 8/8 evidence).

```

### 2026-06-23 — Cursor — Sign-in UX fix (reauth + mobile links)

- Done: anchor-based Google/Microsoft buttons, `/login?reauth=1` when already signed in, dashboard nav shows Account when authenticated
- Deployed to Fly theswitchplatform.com

### 2026-06-23 — Cursor — Microsoft terminal provision + placeholder client_id docs

- Branch: cursor/unified-login-sign-in-page
- Done: `provision:microsoft-oauth-live` script, verify rejects `your-client-id`, AGENTS/HANDOFF/README mermaid + plain-English updates
- Next: `az login` with M365 dev tenant admin → `npm run provision:microsoft-oauth-live:apply`
- Blocker: Fly secrets still placeholder; Hotmail portal login ≠ Azure CLI tenant login

Plain-English summary for the next operator:

- The Microsoft button on `/login` can look ready while Fly still sends a fake client ID to Microsoft.
- Join M365 Developer Program, sign into Azure CLI with **admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com**, run the provision script, then browser-test sign-in.
